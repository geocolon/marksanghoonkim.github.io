  	My name is <strong>Mark Sanghoon Kim</strong>, and this is my personal blog.
  	<br><br>
  	I am a software engineer interested in using software to build useful products. I strongly believe that <strong>empathy</strong> is key. It is key in designing good products, in working well as a member of a team, and in growing as a developer, a leader, and as a person. My favorite questions are: "<strong><em>Why</em></strong> <em>do we do what we do?"</em> and "<b><em>How</em></b> <em>can we do it better?</em>"
    <br><br>
  	I hope to build meaningful relationships with those I work with, and collaborate to develop useful, relevant products.
