  	My name is <strong>Mark Sanghoon Kim</strong>, and this is my personal blog.
  	<br><br>
  	I am an aspiring software engineer interested in using software to build useful products. I strongly believe that <strong>empathy</strong> is key. It is key in designing good products, in working well as a member of a team, and in growing as a developer, a leader, and as a person.
  	<br><br>
  	I studied at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a minor in Environmental Engineering. For the past 3 years, I worked in the oil and gas industry as a project engineer for <a href="https://atmosi.com/" target="_blank">Atmos International</a>, a pipeline technology and software provider. It was during these few years that I learned how to work with clients to build leak detection systems that met their needs. My favorite questions are: "<strong><em>Why</strong> do we do what we do?</em>" and "<strong><em>How</strong> can we do it better?</em>"
  	<br><br>
  	I hope to build meaningful relationships with those I work with, and collaborate to develop useful, meaningful products.
