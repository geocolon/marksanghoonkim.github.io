The idea of nimblecode was borne out of an afternoon when I was playing <a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">typeracer</a> with a few other developers. I thought to myself: "What if we built out a game, like typeracer, but instead of typing out passages, we typed out code?" If it could be made into a competitive game, it could be educational and fun at the same time. That day, <a href="http://nimblecode.io">nimblecode</a> was born.

<h5>Fun and educational</h5>

These principles guided our development. The best way we could provide value to our users would be to make the game fun and educational. So we got to it.

These are some of our early mockups, prepared by one of our developers, <a href="http://www.rickyeh.com">Rick</a>.

I wanted to keep it as simple and as easy as possible for a user to type out code. Repetition is a powerful way to learn something, and one of the ways our users can benefit from nimblecode is the practice of typing out code and the practice of typing out different types of code snippets, whether it be JavaScript ES6 syntax, or a function in Python. This exposure to different languages and code snippets is highly valuable to any budding developer.

Simple and easy, educational and fun were the goals. And nimblecode definitely
