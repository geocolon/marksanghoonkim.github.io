My first post on my blog! I am starting this blog to record my thoughts and experiences in my journey as a software engineer. One of the questions I always ask myself from time to time is <em>"Why am I doing what I'm doing?"</em> I believe the motivation behind any action or decision is as important, if not more important, than the actual results of the action. Why do I want to become a software engineer? Why am I starting this blog?

Well, let me share! I am starting this blog to document what I've been learning and to share my experiences. And I am starting this journey to learn software and web development in order that I take part in building useful, meaningful products. With conscientiousness and humility, I want to learn and grow as an software engineer. And I can't wait to see what the future holds!
