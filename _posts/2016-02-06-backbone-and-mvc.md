Last week we delved into MVC architectural patterns and worked with Backbone during a two day sprint. It was my first experience with a framework, and while it was difficult getting started, by day two of the sprint, my partner and I made significant progress and were adding additional features to our Backbone project. I wanted to share a little more about what I learned during the Backbone sprint.

<a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a> is a JavaScript framework with a RESTful JSON interface. It employs the model-view-presenter (MVP) pattern, which is a derivation of the well-known model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Backbone is described as being lightweight and unopinionated. It allows code modularity by separating the models and views. My project was to create a web audio player that could play songs and queue other songs that would play automatically once the currently playing song ended.
